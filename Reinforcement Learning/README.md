# ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates one of the fundamental algorithms in Reinforcement Learning â€” Q-Learning.
The goal is to train an agent that learns to take optimal actions in an environment based on rewards it receives.

## ðŸš€ Objective

Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy algorithm.
The agent interacts with the environment and learns an optimal policy by updating a Q-table (stateâ€“action table) that estimates the expected reward for each action in each state.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

- State: The current situation or position of the agent.

- Action: The possible move or decision the agent can make.

- Reward: The feedback signal received after taking an action.

- Q-Table: A table that stores Q-values (expected rewards) for each stateâ€“action pair.

- Learning Rate (Î±): Determines how much new information overrides old information.

- Discount Factor (Î³): Defines how much future rewards are valued compared to immediate ones.

- Exploration vs. Exploitation (Îµ): The balance between trying new actions and choosing the best-known action.
